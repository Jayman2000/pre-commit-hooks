# MkDocs pre-commit hook

This repo contains a shim [pre-commit] hook that runs
[`mkdocs build`](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/#building-the-site).
At the moment, this hook assumes that your
[`mkdocs.yml`](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/)
file is in the repo’s root directory.
